## 🎯 Business Problem

Financial institutions face unprecedented challenges in credit risk assessment, with global credit losses exceeding **$32 billion annually**. Traditional credit evaluation methods suffer from significant limitations that directly impact profitability and market competitiveness.

### Current Industry Challenges:
- **High False Positive Rates** (5-10%) causing customer friction and revenue loss
- **Manual Underwriting Processes** resulting in 3-5 day approval times and increased operational costs
- **Limited Predictive Accuracy** with traditional FICO-only models missing 25-30% of actual defaults
- **Regulatory Compliance Complexity** requiring transparent, auditable decision processes
- **Competitive Pressure** from fintech companies offering instant approvals

### Financial Impact of Poor Credit Decisions:
- **$2.8M average annual losses** per major financial institution from defaults
- **$1.2M operational costs** from manual review processes annually
- **15% customer attrition** due to slow approval times and false declines
- **Regulatory penalties** averaging $850K annually for compliance violations
- **Market share erosion** to competitors with faster, more accurate systems

**Business Imperative:** Deploy an AI-powered, enterprise-grade credit risk assessment system capable of real-time processing with industry-leading accuracy while maintaining full regulatory compliance and audit transparency.
